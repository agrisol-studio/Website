          <div class="rowText">
            <p>Agriculture is a science, and we apply it to best fit and complement <span style="font-style:italic">your</span> way of farming. Unfortunately, the industry leads us to believe that there might be a bottled or bagged solution for every agricultural problem. Alternatively, Agrisol first and foremost focuses on the basics: understanding and improving the health of our soil.</p>
            <p style="font-weight:700">Agrisol cares for our farmers.</p>
            <p>On top of that, we also understand agricultural science, and when we say science, we really mean <span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:700">soil</span>.</p>
            <p>Plants don’t need chemicals to grow, what they need is fertile soil. Through a sophisticated process of sampling and information gathering, Agrisol takes the guesswork out of natural growth by maximizing the fertility of the soil, while minimising the inherent risk of farming. We do this in close partnership with farmers, walking alongside them every step of the way by means of our mobile-based platform, which is as effective as it is easy to understand.</p>
            <p>In short, Agrisol makes sure that the soil in which you plant, grow and harvest your crops will be all the more natural, sustainable, and above all, healthy.</p>

            <p>
              Our company was founded in 2010 by our current CEO, GP Schoeman. Initially running the
              business as a solo entrepreneur, it quickly scaled to what we now know as Agrisol. At first all our
              data processing was done via a collection of complicated digital spreadsheets. Fairly quickly it
              became apparent that Agrisol was growing beyond the capacity of our current technology, and
              that we needed to develop our own software solution to better serve our expanding client base<span class="float-right">.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Early in 2014 Agrisol contracted Solution Server to co-develop and create a custom application for our unique business case. After an ongoing successful relationship, Solution Server amalgamated with Agrisol in November 2016<span class="float-right">.</span></p>

                  solutions on behalf of our customers<span class="float-right">.</span>

              <p>Agrisol leads the way locally and internationally when it comes to our industry and our particular knowledge base.

              Agrisol developed an advanced geographical information system which are continually being
              improved and expanded on. After we collect grid samples, we extract other relevant information
              like physical soil data, satellite images and weather statistics for every field, enabling us to give
              the absolute best and up to date recommendations to our customers. To make the data more
              accessible to the farmer and his contributors, we have developed a digital environment where
              every user has immediate access to the most relevant data on his mobile device or desktop.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
              Built into this dynamic digital environment, is the ability to invite external collaborators or service
              providers. With the relevant farmer’s permission, they can then have access to the most recent
              data, enabling them to customise and target their services and products specifically for our
              customers. Typical service providers may include companies that provide agricultural resources
              like fertilizer, lime and chemicals, or even business services like financing or insurance.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
              This cutting edge development will ensure that the farmer has continuous access to a single
              platform, that instantly connects him with all the relevant products and services he might need,
              already tailored to his specific needs.
